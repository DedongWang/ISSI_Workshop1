# Colaboration ideas 

## Case studies of High amplitude EMIC waves during non-storm time from Van Allen Probe. 

The highest wave amplitudes seem to occur during non-storm conditions 

## Why some quiet time substorms create EMIC waves and most do not 

From Van Allen Probes era. 

## Compare different EMIC wave identification methods 

Perhaps see if we can compare different identification methods 

## Compare stats from Van Allen, Arase, and CRRES 

How much difference is because of orbit vs solar cycle.
