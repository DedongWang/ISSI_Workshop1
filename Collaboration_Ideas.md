## Case studies of High amplitude EMIC waves during non-storm time from Van Allen Probe. 

The highest wave amplitudes seem to occur during non-storm conditions 

## Why some quiet time substorms create EMIC waves and most do not 

From Van Allen Probes era. 

## Compare different Van Allen Probes Statistical studies. 

How much do they agree or disagree. 

## Compare different statistical studies from the different missions 

THEMIS, CLUSTER, CREES, AMPTE, Arase, Van Allen Probes, Akabono, MMS, GEOS, GOES, etc. 


## Compare different EMIC wave identification methods 

Perhaps see if we can compare different identification methods 

Compare Andy, Remya, Claudia, and maybe Sigsbee (we need to ask her but they may already be doing this - so either hurry up or wait for their result). 

## Compare stats from Van Allen, Arase, and CRRES 

How much difference is because of orbit vs solar cycle. 

* Need to make sure same method is used to identify EMIC Waves
* Use same analysis type. (e.g. dial plots vs other etc. 
* Should we use the same time period? ~18 months? 


## Compare local/bounced averaged diffusion coeffients with EMIC location and plasma pause/plume conditions. 

How well do waves in different locations interact with relativitistic particles (if they are there - first assume the particles are there - then look to see if they are. So if there were MeV elctrons at L=9 MLT = noon would the wave be effective => state how they might not be due to lack of those MeV particles in that location). 


## September 13th - 14th 2015 
Wide L-value range where EMIC waves were observed (~L=3 to ~L=10) [Yu](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2017JA023982)

* Can we see poynting flux 
* Can we see E-field 
* Can we see composition
* Why so quiet so what made this thing turn on?
