Go through topics from large review paper and present the different discussions. 


## Intro_past_reviews
**Lead author:** Remya Bhanu 

**Additional Authors:** Alexa Halford, David Sibeck 

**Reviewer:** David Sibeck, Ioannis A. Daglis 

**Topics to cover**

Wants this to be catchy - 

* Why do we want to study these waves
  - Need to better understand their relative impact
    + e.g. their impact on atmospheric chemistry 
    + Potential for pockets of increase radiation at aviation altitudes etc. 
  - include them better in models
    + Need to include non-linear effects to get better model results
  - see them around other planetary bodies
  - differnet way to detect them with data  -> pointing towards the cool things in the paper 
* What previous review papers have there been
* What's different from ours

### Past review in addition to those already there.

## What_are_EMIC_waves
**Lead author:** Alexa 

**Additional Authors:**

**Reviewer:** 

**Topics to cover**
* Generation Theory 
* Intitial Observations 
* Propagation of EMIC waves 

Add in and perhaps remove or move to other sections later. 

Add in how to go from three vector magnetic and electric field to spectrogram to idenfication of waves (Ben and Dan and Dedong and Claudia all agreed to help willingly.) 
* issues with data collection/data cleaning 
* identification of poynting flux 
* in identification plus and minuses to identifing by eye vs ML
* Maybe hit on why different orbits have different issues with detection (moving to fast, to low frequency hard to identify etc.)

**Reviewer:** David Sibeck, Dedong Wang 

**Topics to cover**
* Geomagnetic distribution
  - **Lead author:** Lauren Blum
  - **Additional Authors:** Dedong Wang

Could mention ground - but perhaps to only mention the distribution and that they propagate through the ionosphere.

hint at storm dependance 

Maybe include the cartoon of the distribution at least from an all time approach and then each of the other 


Compare different Van Allen Probes Statistical studies. 
* How much do they agree or disagree. 

Compare different statistical studies from the different missions 
 * THEMIS, CLUSTER, CREES, AMPTE, Arase, Van Allen Probes, Akabono, MMS, GEOS, GOES, etc.
