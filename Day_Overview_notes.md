Wants this to be catchy - 

* Why do we want to study these waves
  - Need to better understand their relative impact
    + e.g. their impact on atmospheric chemistry  (Remya will be happy to accept any REFERENCES)  
    + Potential for pockets of increase radiation at aviation altitudes etc. (Willing to accept REFERENCES) 
  - include them better in models
    + Need to include non-linear effects to get better model results
  - see them around other planetary bodies
  - differnet way to detect them with data  -> pointing towards the cool things in the paper 
* What previous review papers have there been
* What's different from ours

### Cold plasma density and EMIC waves
  - **Lead author:** Philip Fernandes
  - **Additional Authors:** Dedong Wang 


#### What Phill would like is what are the important question that should be asked/addressed here. 

* What do we mean when we say "cold plasma". 
  - How do we measure cold plasma 1eV (from Vania)
* Why do we care about the cold plasma. 1 sentence or so
  - plays a role EMIC growth and resonance
  - in modeling/ray tracing codes they need negative gradients. 
* EMIC occurance/characteristics with respect to plasmasphere/pause/plumes (Cartoon vs observations) Maria Spansovoich (not correct spelling) and work with IMAGE with plumes and EMIC waves from the ground. 
* EMIC vs non-EMIC cold plasma densitities 
* impact from cold ions and ion compositions. 
  - What assumptions do we make about the cold composition (Often use what came from warm)
  - Meredith average composition from CRRES
  - Average composition from other satellites 
  - How does Ion composition impact EMIC waves? 
    + What observation of cold ion composition is there? - Hydrogen, Helium, Oxygen, Nitrogen, other heavy ions. (Arase Studies - Alpha or Deuterium) 
    + What makes this a difficult measurement? 
* Can we use the EMIC wave observations to help identify the presence of different ions.
* Multi- ionized plasma (e.g. O+++) [Yu](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2021GL094681)

### Future observations and missions 
  + Upcoming missions
  + Need for new mission ideas 
  + Other planets [Mauk's paper](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2014JA020392)

Many mission ideas talk about the particles - and here we really want to stress the importance of the waves themselves. And that the a wave focused mission might provide a better understanding of the particles (with only particles you don't have unique solutions for the drivers as it's all integrated and could be multiple different combination of effects creating the dynamics we see). 

* Include upcoming missions 
  - GTO might or at least be a pathfinder for potential future missions. 
  - SNIPE 
  - JUICE ? There is a mag so hopefully could get EMIC at Jupiter 
  - GDC ? I don't think so but we should check. 
  - Europa Clipper
  - ESCAPADE
  

* New instrument development 
  - smaller size particle detectors 
  - smaller sized mags and E-field detectors 
  - better downliking get ALLLLLLL the data 
  - or do we have new tech for onboard processes on board and then send down just bits. currently 256Hz sampling rate full wave form data (like Arase using onboard AI - remove noise and then finds the time when there are EMIC waves.) 

* Multi spacecraft - more than 4 needed in a cluster/MMS type mission 
  - need this to get away from the plane wave assumption to see the different modes of the EMIC Waves. 
* More multi spacecraft - but spread out across MLT and L to get spatial and temperal scale sizes of these active regions 
* More multi spacecraft along a field line to see the propagation effects and how the wave changes with respect to latitude 
   - How does this impact mode convestion and look at how we would study this. 
   - as we get into the ionosphere look at into the ducting. 
* How can cubeSats help with this! Better coverage through smaller satellites (so cheaper individually) but providing us much more coverage of the waves. 
  - Think about outside of LEO 
  - Think about mag vs E-field issues 
  - Think about particles included with the wave measurements. 
    + Think about what particles - 
    + ions generating / amplifying the waves - and include composition 
    + electrons with what's being precipitated? 
 
* Other planets and places 
  - even more issues with downlinking data because having to use DSN. 
  -  Issues with getting low frequency DC electric fields so a need for a heliospheric waves mission. 
  -  Need more wave instruments on planetary missions. 


### Future therory 

* Theory to understand why EMIC waves often are seen to be linearly polarized and sometimes even right hand polarized - and then how this impacts interactions. 
  - so could be mode conversion
  - can also be propagation (makes sense) 
  - Is this a problem of not understanding our observations? 
  - Is this a problem of not calculating the polarization correctly? 
* Improve quasi-linear assumption within the models. - help to improve interactions near 90 deg. (resonance broadening).   
* Have we gone as far as we can in linear/tracktable theories or do we need more improvements? 

### Future Modeling 

* Be able to have more of full kinetic in global models. 
* How to better include waves in global models 
  - better spatcial and temporal accurate inclusion of the waves (localized more in L and less limited in MLT - but include the odd dynamics in the waves wrt amplitude frequency and all- so when we have lots of wave packets with space between them as you go from one location to the next). 
* Need better emperical wave models 
  - Need big data base 
  - need all avalible satellite data and they need to be intercalibrated 
  - need an empirical model of the ion composition and temperature anisotropy. 
  - Need empircal parameters of See if we can get views from more modelers on what is most important. 
    + band width (Maybe third most important) 
    + wave amplitude (Most important)
    + frequency/ ratio to cyclotron frequency (Maybe second most important) 
    + wave normal 
* Self consistent modeling - Vanya will help to write this bit up. 
* With modeling for wave growth include muti-ionized ion composition -> need to improve our understanding of the importance of these populations and their relative composition. 
* Can Machine learning help with the emperical wave modeling? 
  - Can this be used to create a model of when/where/how strong the waves are.
