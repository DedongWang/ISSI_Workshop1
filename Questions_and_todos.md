## New EMIC wave cartoon
* See if we can update the Summers cartoon 
  - All time 
  - Storm phases
  - use data ? or better to have the cartoon drawing? 


## Check for consistant language throughout paper 
* all varibles are consistent throughout (e. g. S = pointing flux or spieces or what?) 
* British or American English. 


## Data analysis methods? 
* Identification 
  - ML
  - Fourier transform
  - wavelets
  - polarization 
  - elipticity etc. 
  - poynting flux
 * Multi-space craft analysis 
  - Comparison - are they the same wave 
    + Bouncing wave packet? 
    + Backward wave oscillator.
